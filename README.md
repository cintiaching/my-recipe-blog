# my-recipe-blog
A toy project to pick up Django and React.

Following ["Django 5 by Example"](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Django-5-By-Example) and online tutorials.

## Setup
Note for myself to remember how to set up from scratch.

### React
- Creating a Vite project
    ```
  npm create vite@latest
  ```
  Input the name of the project `my-recipe-frontend`, select `React`, then `TypeScript`

- then run
  ```
  cd my-recipe-frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

### Django

This will create a Django project with the name mysite.
```shell
django-admin startproject mysite
```
